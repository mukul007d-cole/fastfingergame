In just 3 hours, I created a simple yet engaging game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. balls with random numbers appear on the screen, and you're given a target number to find. Click the correct ball to score +10 points, but bewareâ€”click the wrong one, and you'll lose 5 points. The goal? Score as high as possible before time runs out.
